This reminded of the times my parents would talk about meeting up in the village square or the common ground with their friends everyday as that was the only way they could communicate back then. Quickly worked out a plan and the logistics and set out in search of a historic site with two of my friends to create a frame which i thought would suit my theme. Upon reaching there we realised we did not have any network and were struggling to find references. Thats when the subjects of my shoot started talking to each other about the jewellery and some other things. It was not planned and my lights weren't set but the frame had materialised. The lack of network did take us back in time and i got to witness the moment without any direction.",

A dervish practices multiple rituals, the primary of which is the dhikr, a remembering of Allah.The dhikr involves recitation of devotional Islamic prayer.This dhikr is coupled with physical exertions of movement, specifically dancing and whirling, in order to reach a state of trance.",

Historically, Tuluvas did not believe in God, they only believed in bhootas. Tulavas believe that these bhootas once walked the land as humans, and everyone joins them after death.\r\n \r\n These bhootas are invoked and personified by a paatri (an individual from the Nalike community who impersonates the bhoota at bhootaradhane) during the annual festival of bhootaradhane. \r\n \r\n Hope you got to know about another ancient ritual art form from southern part India via this image.",

It has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the remainder of my life. At the time, my passion for photography had grown so much that I was yearning to do it professionally but the frantic thought \"you need a camera first\" kept flooding my mind, until, like a flip of a switch, I realized that the one thing that seemed like an obstruction, really isnât. The man reflects the thought, hence why he's holding a camera with a villainous look, while, the lit bulb represents realization.Many are still in the dark, obstructed from tapping into their full potential as a creative.

No living thing is tortured during mourning. The basic principle of the Mourning Fast is not to break anyone's heart, not to hurt anyone with one's tongue, not to gossip about anyone. Those in good health fast. The purpose of mourning is not to torture oneself, but to commemorate and not forget so that evil and massacres do not happen again",

Sometimes these selections take days if you have to make too many selections. Later using these selections while playing with the darks (shadows) and lights (highlights) the final envisioned version of the image is brought forward. Finally, you feel happy and more confident with all the time and efforts you spent to create the masterpiece.",

I walked 45 minutes, from the top of the bridge to the photo spot. During the walk the van of the filming crew passed me. This time no doubt, I will see them down the road.\r\n \r\n I arrived and they were all here, cameras settled up, waiting for the next train. After a short talk with them I learned that they were filming for a Japanese TV travel documentary that runs the world by train since 1987, called Â« Sekai no shako kara Â» which means Views of the World by a train. That kind of funny random meetings you make along the roads.

The plan was to stay there for a week, but extended the tour in the hopes of snowfall and was blessed with snowfall in Srinagar in the last week. Snowfall turned the whole city into white beauty.\r\n \r\n On the next day I was blessed with this beautiful cloud porn in Dal lake. To witness snowfall on the previous day and this cloud porn on the next day was just like cherry on the cake.\r\n \r\n This beautiful landscape covered in snow with amazing clouds and it's clear reflection in Dal Lake just felt like a beautiful dream. I got to know why Kashmir is called \"Heaven on Earth\" when I witnessed this peaceful view in Srinagar.",

Towards the end of a full day on the beach, walking and jesting with friends, capturing the beauty of the place, it was pack up time to further continue the journey. Just as I was walking away, I looked back one last time, camera still in hand, this frame was waiting to be captured â ash grey skies contrasted with silver waves against the hillocks, which comes to my mind as - âJourney of Soulsâ.",

The photo was taken in a thickly wooded area near my house (an old nursery) which was abandoned due to Covid restrictions and has became a safe haven and breeding ground for many insects during the season. Green lynx spider takes enough time to feed on its prey (sometime hours) giving enough opportunity to take photos with proper settings. \r\n To takes this photo external light source (Flash with homemade diffuser) was used as light becomes a crisis in the bushes in wooded areas during cloudy monsoon days. \r\n This photograph is in the finals of HIPA 2021-22-Nature (winner yet to be declared)",

Macro photogs travel to Singapore to shoot this jumper as it is a rarity among jumping spider lovers. I feel lucky to have this beautiful jumper. Jumpers have 8 eyes and it will be enlightening to learn how it uses all its eyes to track its prey.\r\n Superpower: Hyllus diardi can leap up to 20 times their body length. Humans in comparison can jump only upto 5 times their body length.",

The image perfectly exploit the connection among science and the inherent artistic appeal of soap bubbles.\r\n Foams are ubiquitous in daily life, they are made by the union of small bubbles and despite the visual balance conveyed by these arrangements, their structure has a complex and delicate construction. When you look at a bubble, what you're really seeing is some air trapped inside a thin film, consisting of two outer layers of soap that surround an inner layer of water.\r\n Through this photo the observer is taken to an extreme approximation of the foamâs morphology. From this standpoint it's possible to admire these elegant skeletal structures with an almost surreal appearance, making them appear unfamiliar, and sometimes even strange, capturing the impressive aesthetic perfection of these bubbles.",

This is attributable to the pathetic condition of their workshops, the leakages on the porous roofs end up âbrutallyâ damaging the clay idols & their spirit.\r\n \r\n However, when the prayers were not answered in the year 2021, I decided to venture into this iconic spot with the aim to document those moments of struggle.",

After a couple of failed attempts, it was finally able to catch a fish. I was sitting quite close to it and was able to take a couple of images with nice details. \r\n The determination of the bird taught me how important it is to never give up and how strong the power of patience, dedication and perseverance can be.

            "Description": "One of the best periods of my life was working as an intern at Agumbe Rainforest Research Station, where I was part of the King Cobra Ecology and Conservation project. During one of my days in the field, I was resting in my hammock when it suddenly started to rain. I decided to go shoot some birds which I could hear calling in the neighbouring paddy field, since it was starting to fill up due to the heavy downpour. This collected water acted as a hotspot for many birds and thus using it to my advantage I started taking some photographs. I viewed my recent captures as soon as I called time, and this photograph caught my eye; it seemed as if one of the Ibises was shadowing the movements of the other and that too under the rain! I can never forget this beautiful moment I was a witness to!\r\n \r\n Shot by: Pranay Bhatnagar\r\n \r\n Location: Agumbe, Karnataka, India\r\n \r\n Year: 2019",

My photography celebrates possibility: by showing the vastness of space, my work shows and celebrates our opportunity to grow, explore and embrace the unexpected. While the average individual may simply be interested in how soothing a picture is to the eyes, a photographic artist may be looking at the composition of the picture, the use of colors and light, and any additional meanings conveyed by the picture. Humans tend to organize the disorderly world in an intelligible way, but sometimes we reverse the process in an attempt to disintegrate the world order into disorder. Does the world have an order?

All income goes towards our Marine conservation and Protection Projects.\r\n \r\n A few Facts about Manta Rays\r\n \r\n The word âmantaâ is actually Spanish for blanket or cloak, and itâs pretty easy to see the connection.\r\n Manta rays have the largest brain to body weight ratio of any living fish; giving it enough cleverness to make the average dolphin jealous.\r\n A fully grown oceanic manta ray can reach a wing span of up to 7 meters and weigh up to two tonnes.\r\n Manta Rays are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine.\r\n \r\n Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore.\r\n We are protecting these gorgeous Sea Angels!",
