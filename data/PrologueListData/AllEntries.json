How can i be free from this anguish of your constant abuse? Happiness, laughter, love and care, fled my life the day u took control over me. My worth is like spilt milk on rocks and all my six senses are bruised beyond repair. What is my crime? trust, love, loyalty and patience? I doubt i am still sane. The stigma of your abuse sticks fast.",

All elements here are woven together starting from icebergs to coral reefs, deserts to modern settlements. It is the duty of all to learn everyday practices to contribute less pollution into the bed of the earth. And duty of governments to take effective measures which will put kid activists back to schools because they can finally dream of a future. Do we still have a chance to reverse climate change? Maybe. Yes. Woven lives is just one of the ways in that direction. We have miles to go.",

That is why she gives back to them. \r\n \r\n Ploughing at night. Why not. ?\r\n Rainbows in the moonlight. Why not. ?\r\n Multi coloured grass and shrub. WHY…NOT ?\r\n \r\n Let us find our “new” Earth and when we do let’s not bring in all the pettiness of this earth to our “Another Earth”. \r\n \r\n That may be our final chance..",

In a world where things are most of the time viewed in binary transgender women still search for their identity from a third perspective. They may not be born women, but they are women just like any others. Beautiful, strong, and feminine in every way possible. \r\n \r\n PS: The submitted artwork is AR-enabled.

            "Description": "What remains of the centuries old city of Kochi is now a dystopian sunset paradise.\r\n The after effects of pollution caused by the wars of the previous generations have rendered the air harmful for humans. Plants grow inside greenariums, nowhere else and animals are nothing but memorial sculptures by the road.\r\n Humans have however shielded themselves inside robots to avoid direct exposure to the harmful atmospheric light & air. As time passed by, the robots became more than just mechanical units, rather people began to consider them as expressions of genderless fashion. Slowly due to lack of other interesting avenues of expression, the society began to deeply focus on excessive display of fashion on robots to the extent where it became a normal to do so. Thus a high fashion society was born in 2200 AD.",

The astronaut in the piece can represent every single one of us if we are overconsuming social media\r\n So next time when you're overconsuming just remember that you're wasting a part of your life that could've been an even better memory.",

We reached the nearest beach which was like 120 km away and we reached there a bit early I mean 4 in the morning and there was no light we waited it out, The waiting was worth it and the beach we went to was a bit different the shore was a bit long and the sun came up the ocean came out. And there was a boat that was there and that got me an idea of making this piece. \r\n \r\n Created on Blender.",

Toxicity effects the mental health of a person when it hits you with self doubts and you start to feel that you're not enough for the relationship where you're putting the efforts into. In a toxic relationship there's always someone very cunning who uses other person's weakness for their own benefits. Not every relationship is like that and I'm happy that some people finds the one with whom they genuinely feel happy.",

From societal norms, a precursor to recklessness. \r\n \r\n Our perception of life is limited to our likes and dislikes. We like Metallica but hate Taylor swift. We love kaju katli but hate jalebi. Some even love raspberrys & hate mangoes. It is uncanny but our dislikes are often a passion for another. Einstein could spend hours cracking a 3 syllable equation when we would rather spend our time frolicking in the sun.\r\n \r\n In my limited understanding, freedom is being able to stay open, come awake and experience what life has to offer. Whatever life has to offer, whatever is here and now. To come Awake. To come Alive. To breath the open sky, to slip into the fragrance of the deepest jungles, to dive the deepest oceans and to embrace the madness of truly being alive.",

This reminded of the times my parents would talk about meeting up in the village square or the common ground with their friends everyday as that was the only way they could communicate back then. Quickly worked out a plan and the logistics and set out in search of a historic site with two of my friends to create a frame which i thought would suit my theme. Upon reaching there we realised we did not have any network and were struggling to find references. Thats when the subjects of my shoot started talking to each other about the jewellery and some other things. It was not planned and my lights weren't set but the frame had materialised. The lack of network did take us back in time and i got to witness the moment without any direction.",

The celebration begins a week early \r\n and looks quite different in the towns of Barsana and Nandgaon than the rest of the \r\n country. Walking in the footsteps of Lord Krishna, the men of Nandgaon (Krishna’s \r\n village) head to Barsana (Radha’s village) to play Holi; the next day, the men of Barsana \r\n travel to Nandgaon with colours. In both the villages, the local women “beat” the \r\n visiting young men with sticks, just like Radha and the gopis did to little Krishna. But \r\n Lathmaar Holi (Holi of sticks) is more of a festive dance than a confrontation. On the \r\n third day, residents of both the villages get together and head over to Vrindavan to play \r\n Phoolon ki Holi (Holi of flowers). \r\n — ROHIT GADHER ON HIS PHOTOGRAPH, TAKEN WITH A SAMSUNG GALAXY A72 IN MARCH 2021",

Tulavas believe that these bhootas once walked the land as humans, and everyone joins them after death.\r\n \r\n These bhootas are invoked and personified by a paatri (an individual from the Nalike community who impersonates the bhoota at bhootaradhane) during the annual festival of bhootaradhane. \r\n \r\n Hope you got to know about another ancient ritual art form from southern part India via this image.",

            "Description": "To me, epiphany refers to a sudden revelation of the 'whatness' of a thing. We may have an epiphany, or perhaps numerous epiphanies, these realizations may be little and insignificant, or they may even be massive. \r\n That is what this piece is about, an epiphany of my own. It has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the remainder of my life. At the time, my passion for photography had grown so much that I was yearning to do it professionally but the frantic thought \"you need a camera first\" kept flooding my mind, until, like a flip of a switch, I realized that the one thing that seemed like an obstruction, really isn’t. The man reflects the thought, hence why he's holding a camera with a villainous look, while, the lit bulb represents realization.Many are still in the dark, obstructed from tapping into their full potential as a creative. The aim of this piece is to bring them to light, THE EPIPHANY.",

The shepherds, who bring thousands of sheep to the village for milking in herds every day, start the 7-kilometer dusty journey towards the skirts of Mount Nemrut at sunset after milking. The dusty journey of the herds creates a visual feast throughout the valley. The control of their herds in these dusty valleys belongs to the child shepherds between the ages of 10 and 12. In this photo, the little shepherd is chasing the herds with the wind rose he holds in his hand with the feeling of childhood.",

The outfit of one of these workers immediately caught my attention. This worker, who was busy watering the tulips, wore a T-shirt and yellow boots reminiscent of the colors of the honey bee. This situation was very compatible with the environment in which he was working. I waited for the right moment and photographed it. I was very happy to have a wonderful image and wanted to share it with you.",

I felt the drama of a massacre that took place centuries ago. That moment.\r\n \r\n During mourning, knives and cutting tools are not touched, sacrificed, and meat is not eaten. No living thing is tortured during mourning. The basic principle of the Mourning Fast is not to break anyone's heart, not to hurt anyone with one's tongue, not to gossip about anyone. Those in good health fast. The purpose of mourning is not to torture oneself, but to commemorate and not forget so that evil and massacres do not happen again",

With industrialisation and tourism attracting thousands, I felt the need to preserve this heritage through photographs.\r\n \r\n The Sadhu in the frame is Praying at 5AM in Manikarnika Ghat - The oldest Burning Ghat of Varanasi. The Smoke in the background is coming out of Burning Bodies as it was the peak of COVID in India and there was a Queue of Dead Bodies waiting to be cremated at the ghat. \r\n \r\n Photographer : Ayush Dixit\r\n \r\n Edition : 1/1\r\n \r\n Location : Varanasi , India .\r\n \r\n Year Created : 2021\r\n \r\n Gear : Smartphone - Vivo V20PRO\r\n \r\n Genre : Street Photography .",

I was not the only one here for it. A little bit further, at the end of the track, a van was waiting for them, and I felt like we will be a lot on the spot that day. I walked 45 minutes, from the top of the bridge to the photo spot. During the walk the van of the filming crew passed me. This time no doubt, I will see them down the road.\r\n \r\n I arrived and they were all here, cameras settled up, waiting for the next train. After a short talk with them I learned that they were filming for a Japanese TV travel documentary that runs the world by train since 1987, called « Sekai no shako kara » which means Views of the World by a train. That kind of funny random meetings you make along the roads. Hope they did get what they wanted from that day shooting the Polar Express.\r\n \r\n Artist: Joffrey Briaud\r\n Size: 4119x6182\r\n License: Unlimited Commercial",

The image perfectly exploit the connection among science and the inherent artistic appeal of soap bubbles.\r\n Foams are ubiquitous in daily life, they are made by the union of small bubbles and despite the visual balance conveyed by these arrangements, their structure has a complex and delicate construction. When you look at a bubble, what you're really seeing is some air trapped inside a thin film, consisting of two outer layers of soap that surround an inner layer of water.\r\n Through this photo the observer is taken to an extreme approximation of the foam’s morphology. From this standpoint it's possible to admire these elegant skeletal structures with an almost surreal appearance, making them appear unfamiliar, and sometimes even strange, capturing the impressive aesthetic perfection of these bubbles.",

This is attributable to the pathetic condition of their workshops, the leakages on the porous roofs end up “brutally” damaging the clay idols & their spirit.\r\n \r\n However, when the prayers were not answered in the year 2021, I decided to venture into this iconic spot with the aim to document those moments of struggle.",

An intense five letter word in the Indian subcontinent finds its significance in the hearts of people irrespective of their backgrounds.\r\n \r\n A man in the said image takes a holy dip in the Yamuna River, on an early foggy winter morning before getting on with his day where his faith will drive away any difficulties that he might encounter.\r\n \r\n Coming under one umbrella that unites people can be tough in a diverse land but a mind that believes in moving past all distractions from getting divided is joined by the power of belief and faith.",

After a couple of failed attempts, it was finally able to catch a fish. I was sitting quite close to it and was able to take a couple of images with nice details. \r\n The determination of the bird taught me how important it is to never give up and how strong the power of patience, dedication and perseverance can be. Moments like these and many more in Nature are always trying to convey vital life lessons for us all, because no matter what, we all are connected in this circle of life.

This collected water acted as a hotspot for many birds and thus using it to my advantage I started taking some photographs.

Me and my friends stopped at a desert to relax a little. Suddenly, I saw a camel coming just like a hope from a side against the sun and it looked as beautiful as my dreams. All I did at that moment was to take out my camera and capture it.",

These flowers generally blossom during the Autumn every year throughout Northeast and Bengal giving the vibe of the Auspicious Indian Festival called Durga Puja. I have actually grown up in such country-side atmosphere and seeing these two boys fishing in the pond just reminded me of my childhood.

Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine.\r\n \r\n Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore.\r\n We are protecting these gorgeous Sea Angels!",

So, I tried to write something totally opposite and counter that negativity. This piece I wrote in July 2020 in the lockdown. A time when a lot of us were dealing with our inner demons. All of us have your strengths, and we shouldn’t put ourselves down for something we haven’t been able to do “YET”. The other would be my love for fantasy as a genre. Every good book, movie and series brings great joy to me. But it also makes me feel disappointed that I live in this reality, it’s so bound together.

The natural light from the window lit her beautifully keeping some of her face and the top she wore in shadow making in more intriguing.

            "Description": "Smile is the universal language of kindness because it has the power to change the world.\r\n I drew this artwork back in 2017, it was the early phase when I just started learning to sketch. \r\n In this portrait, I tried to depict the \"Smile of eyes\" which people usually ignores to catch it. The eyes of a Human have the power to hold many secrets and also have the power to reveal many secrets by saying nothing from a mouth. \r\n \"As Mother Teresa said- Peace begins with a Smile\"\r\n If you see someone's eyes you can predict their emotions- the feeling of happiness, sadness, anger, dilemma, confusion, fear, love, satisfaction, hatred, etc. \r\n Medium- Graphite and Charcoal on A4 Size Paper",

This form of Abstract Expressionism is a homage to experiencing truth in the moment - the moment when the brush hits the canvas and the flow one's feelings or thoughts create - oblivious to the rules of society or even art itself. Made by Priyanka Jain aka Piyu, an Acrylic and Figurative artist, she wants to spread the message to - \"Be free. Be you\" with this painting.",

Dream! And fly with the Golden thoughts",
