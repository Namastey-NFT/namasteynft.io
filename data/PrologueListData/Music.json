            "Description": "Awaken is a call to freedom. \r\n\r\nFreedom is an often revolutionised term. Associated with breaking free from \"chains that bind you\". From societal norms, a precursor to recklessness. \r\n\r\nOur perception of life is limited to our likes and dislikes. We like Metallica but hate Taylor swift. We love kaju katli but hate jalebi. Some even love raspberrys & hate mangoes. It is uncanny but our dislikes are often a passion for another. Einstein could spend hours cracking a 3 syllable equation when we would rather spend our time frolicking in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn my limited understanding, freedom is being able to stay open, come awake and experience what life has to offer. Whatever life has to offer, whatever is here and now. To come Awake. To come Alive. To breath the open sky, to slip into the fragrance of the deepest jungles, to dive the deepest oceans and to embrace the madness of truly being alive.",
