We are much more in between the two opposing natures. And the beauty in between is only visible to a patient eye.\r\n \r\n This poetry was inspired by the author's personal experience in one of her intimate relationships and also by Albert Camus' philosophy of acceptance that he explains using the analogy of Sysiphus, a Greek mythological character.",

All of us have your strengths, and we shouldn‚Äôt put ourselves down for something we haven‚Äôt been able to do ‚ÄúYET‚Äù. The other would be my love for fantasy as a genre. Every good book, movie and series brings great joy to me. But it also makes me feel disappointed that I live in this reality, it‚Äôs so bound together.
