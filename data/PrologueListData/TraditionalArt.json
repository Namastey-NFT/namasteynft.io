Thinking if all the hardwork will pay at the end with all the struggles of being educated, the bad environment of learning, lack of finance and ills of the society.\r\n \r\n At the realm of uncertainty, one is confronted by a variety of choices; one barely knows which leads to the Big Picture. As the boys in the artwork, budding into youthful age, do not know whether they’ll survive by formal education or by their potentials, so is one fixed at the crossroads of uncertainty. \r\n \r\n While one sees roads to greater achievements, one is kept on a leash taut as stick by norms, laws, dogmas, “this-is-how-we-do-it!”, “this-is-how-you-must-do-it!”... One therefore needs to break free. But t",

There was a very interesting flow in her gestures with the hands, the arms and her tilted head creating some very nice organic curves. The natural light from the window lit her beautifully keeping some of her face and the top she wore in shadow making in more intriguing. At the end I was pleased that I managed to the capture the spirit and elegance of Chantal with this drawing, done in charcoal.",

This impression has been formed by news stories, adventure movies or magazine photos in mainstream media. \r\n \r\n But with this piece I want to say to the world that Africa is just as entrepreneuring as every other continent. Plus it is not a single country but a continent with 54 countries. Many \"top 10 fastest growing economies\" have a lot of African countries. The youth are as brilliant and creative as ever and the African NFT community shows this. \r\n \r\n Size: 26×36 inches",

The eyes of a Human have the power to hold many secrets and also have the power to reveal many secrets by saying nothing from a mouth. \r\n \"As Mother Teresa said- Peace begins with a Smile\"\r\n If you see someone's eyes you can predict their emotions- the feeling of happiness, sadness, anger, dilemma, confusion, fear, love, satisfaction, hatred, etc. \r\n Medium- Graphite and Charcoal on A4 Size Paper",

This form of Abstract Expressionism is a homage to experiencing truth in the moment - the moment when the brush hits the canvas and the flow one's feelings or thoughts create - oblivious to the rules of society or even art itself. Made by Priyanka Jain aka Piyu, an Acrylic and Figurative artist, she wants to spread the message to - \"Be free. Be you\" with this painting.",

Dream! And fly with the Golden thoughts",
