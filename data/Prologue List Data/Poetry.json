We are much more in between the two opposing natures. And the beauty in between is only visible to a patient eye.\r\n\r\nThis poetry was inspired by the author's personal experience in one of her intimate relationships and also by Albert Camus' philosophy of acceptance that he explains using the analogy of Sysiphus, a Greek mythological character.",

            "Description": "There are two parts to this poem. Have you ever had those days where you feel lesser of yourself? Well, me too. So, I tried to write something totally opposite and counter that negativity. This piece I wrote in July 2020 in the lockdown. A time when a lot of us were dealing with our inner demons. All of us have your strengths, and we shouldn’t put ourselves down for something we haven’t been able to do “YET”. The other would be my love for fantasy as a genre. Every good book, movie and series brings great joy to me. But it also makes me feel disappointed that I live in this reality, it’s so bound together. So, I thought, I’d change the very definition of “Magic”. That would be my magic. So, I felt like I should \"Spread a little magic!\"",
