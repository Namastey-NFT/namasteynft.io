How can i be free from this anguish of your constant abuse? Happiness, laughter, love and care, fled my life the day u took control over me. My worth is like spilt milk on rocks and all my six senses are bruised beyond repair. What is my crime? trust, love, loyalty and patience? I doubt i am still sane. The stigma of your abuse sticks fast.",

All elements here are woven together starting from icebergs to coral reefs, deserts to modern settlements. It is the duty of all to learn everyday practices to contribute less pollution into the bed of the earth. And duty of governments to take effective measures which will put kid activists back to schools because they can finally dream of a future. Do we still have a chance to reverse climate change? Maybe. Yes. Woven lives is just one of the ways in that direction. We have miles to go.",

That is why she gives back to them. \r\n\r\nPloughing at night. Why not. ?\r\nRainbows in the moonlight. Why not. ?\r\nMulti coloured grass and shrub.

Relating this to the transgender community the stigma and prejudice created by the majority of the society altogether leads to symbolic degradation as well as the formation of identity. In a world where things are most of the time viewed in binary transgender women still search for their identity from a third perspective. They may not be born women, but they are women just like any others. Beautiful, strong, and feminine in every way possible. \r\n\r\nPS: The submitted artwork is AR-enabled.

As time passed by, the robots became more than just mechanical units, rather people began to consider them as expressions of genderless fashion. Slowly due to lack of other interesting avenues of expression, the society began to deeply focus on excessive display of fashion on robots to the extent where it became a normal to do so. Thus a high fashion society was born in 2200 AD.",

We reached the nearest beach which was like 120 km away and we reached there a bit early I mean 4 in the morning and there was no light we waited it out, The waiting was worth it and the beach we went to was a bit different the shore was a bit long and the sun came up the ocean came out. And there was a boat that was there and that got me an idea of making this piece. \r\n\r\nCreated on Blender.",

The insecurities, overthinking hits you hard when the person you're in love with starts to take you for granted and looks out for validation in someone else. Toxicity effects the mental health of a person when it hits you with self doubts and you start to feel that you're not enough for the relationship where you're putting the efforts into. In a toxic relationship there's always someone very cunning who uses other person's weakness for their own benefits. Not every relationship is like that and I'm happy that some people finds the one with whom they genuinely feel happy.",
