Thinking if all the hardwork will pay at the end with all the struggles of being educated, the bad environment of learning, lack of finance and ills of the society.\r\n\r\nAt the realm of uncertainty, one is confronted by a variety of choices; one barely knows which leads to the Big Picture. As the boys in the artwork, budding into youthful age, do not know whether they’ll survive by formal education or by their potentials, so is one fixed at the crossroads of uncertainty. \r\n\r\nWhile one sees roads to greater achievements, one is kept on a leash taut as stick by norms, laws, dogmas, “this-is-how-we-do-it!”, “this-is-how-you-must-do-it!”... One therefore needs to break free. But t",

There was a very interesting flow in her gestures with the hands, the arms and her tilted head creating some very nice organic curves. The natural light from the window lit her beautifully keeping some of her face and the top she wore in shadow making in more intriguing.

This impression has been formed by news stories, adventure movies or magazine photos in mainstream media. \r\n\r\nBut with this piece I want to say to the world that Africa is just as entrepreneuring as every other continent. Plus it is not a single country but a continent with 54 countries. Many \"top 10 fastest growing economies\" have a lot of African countries. The youth are as brilliant and creative as ever and the African NFT community shows this. \r\n\r\nSize: 26×36 inches",

            "Description": "Smile is the universal language of kindness because it has the power to change the world.\r\nI drew this artwork back in 2017, it was the early phase when I just started learning to sketch. \r\nIn this portrait, I tried to depict the \"Smile of eyes\" which people usually ignores to catch it. The eyes of a Human have the power to hold many secrets and also have the power to reveal many secrets by saying nothing from a mouth. \r\n\"As Mother Teresa said- Peace begins with a Smile\"\r\nIf you see someone's eyes you can predict their emotions- the feeling of happiness, sadness, anger, dilemma, confusion, fear, love, satisfaction, hatred, etc. \r\nMedium- Graphite and Charcoal on A4 Size Paper",

This painting in watercolor medium is a tribute to all the performers who immerse themselves in these rituals, festivals and artforms.",

This form of Abstract Expressionism is a homage to experiencing truth in the moment - the moment when the brush hits the canvas and the flow one's feelings or thoughts create - oblivious to the rules of society or even art itself. Made by Priyanka Jain aka Piyu, an Acrylic and Figurative artist, she wants to spread the message to - \"Be free. Be you\" with this painting.",
